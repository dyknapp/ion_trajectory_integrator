% This is a basic example illustrating a MATI using an electrode stack
% This is done in Cartesian coordinates; for cylindrical, see the

% A lot of the comments below will be copied verbatim from the example:

% This is the main example for this repository, and it is more likely that
% I remember to update it with new changes, especially when it comes to
% further FORTRAN development.  The MATLAB side will probably stay static.
% The main purpose of reproducing the comments here is for convenience.
